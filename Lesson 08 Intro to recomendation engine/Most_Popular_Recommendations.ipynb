    "For this task, we will consider what is \"most popular\" based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A movie with the highest average rating is considered best\n",
    "* With ties, movies that have more ratings are better\n",
    "* A movie must have a minimum of 5 ratings to be considered among the best movies\n",
    "* If movies are tied in their average rating and number of ratings, the ranking is determined by the movie that is the most recent rating\n",
    "\n",
    "With these criteria, the goal for this notebook is to take a **user_id** and provide back the **n_top** recommendations.  Use the function below as the scaffolding that will be used for all the future recommendations as well."
